Contributing to Documentation
=============================

We (like almost all open source software providers) have a documentation dilemmaâ€¦ We tend to focus on the code features and functionality before working on documentation. And there is very good reason for this: we want to share the love so nobody feels left out!

You can contribute to the documentation by `raising an issue to suggest an improvement <https://github.com/ctrliq/warewulf-docs/issues/new>`_ or by sending a `pull request <https://github.com/ctrliq/warewulf-docs/compare>`_ on `our repository for documentation <https://github.com/ctrliq/warewulf-docs>`_.

The current documentation is generated with:

- `reStructured Text (RST) <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ and `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_.

Other dependencies include:

- `Python 3.5 or newer <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

- `Sphinx <https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/>`_.

More information about contributing to the documentation, instructions on how to install the dependencies, and how to generate the files can be obtained `here <https://github.com/ctrliq/warewulf-docs/blob/master/README.md>`__.

For more information on using Git and GitHub to create a pull request suggesting additions and edits to the docs, see the :ref:`section on contributing to the code <contribute-to-the-code>`. The procedure is identical for contributions to the documentation and the code base.
